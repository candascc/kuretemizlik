-- Migration: 033_recurring_occurrences_company
-- This migration has been converted to PHP (033_recurring_occurrences_company.php)
-- because SQLite doesn't support IF NOT EXISTS for ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN
-- This SQL file is kept for reference only
--
-- The PHP migration checks if company_id exists before adding it,
-- preventing "duplicate column" errors
